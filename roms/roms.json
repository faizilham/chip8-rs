        "description": "Biorhythm, by Jef Winsor<br/><br/>The theory of Biorhythm states that there are thre predominant cycles that can influence human behavior. These include a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle and a 33-day intellectual cycle.  All three cycles start at birth and continue throughout life.<br/><br/>Each cycle consists of a positive and a negative period.  Physical, Emotional and Intellectual aspects are enhanced during positive periods.  Poor performance is indicated by the negative period of a cycle.<br/><br/>A critical day occurs on the crossover from the positive to the negative period or vice versa. A critical day indicates instability in a particular aspect. <br/><br/>How to Use Biorhythm: <br/><br/>1. Enter birthdate using 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year.<br/><br/>2. Enter start date using 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year. The start date indicates the first day of the 32-day Biorhythm chart the program will generate.<br/><br/>3. After a period of calculation proportional to the span of time involved, the three cycle curves will be shown for a 32-day period. Each horizontal bit position represents one day in the cycle. The start day, on the left, and every seventh day are indicated by week markers. The first day of a positive or negative period is a critical day.<br/><br/>4. To advance the start date, hold key F down until the desired date is reached. To decrement the start date, hold key B down. These functions allow changing the start date slightly without reentering all the dates and waiting for the calculations to be preformed.<br/><br/>5. Press Key 0 to clear the screen and enter a new set of dates."

When you press any of the keys, it brings another random number up on the screen. This goes on until you quit the program. Address 0x202 holds the C0FF instruction, which commands the CHIP-8 interpreter to set V0 to a random number with the mask 0xFF. This yields 256 different possible numbers (0-255). If C0FF is changed to something like C00A, then the mask will change. This would yield 11 different possible numbers (0-10)."
